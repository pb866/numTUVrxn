Programme numTUVrxn
===================

Purpose
-------

This is a simple FORTRAN routine to relabel TUV photolysis reactions after
ammendments. The programme relies on the fixed format of the TUV input file
and is designed for TUV 5.2. Consecutive 3-digit reaction numbers are
assigned starting at 1.

Compiling the programme
-----------------------

Compile with `<compiler> numTUVrxn -o numTUVrxn`. The programme has been
tested for the `gfortran` compiler.

Preparing model runs
--------------------

Edit your TUV input file by editing, adding or deleting reactions. If you
want the TUV output only for a fraction of the reactions, switch those
reactions to `T` (first character of each reaction line) and the rest to
`F`. If you want all reactions to be true or false, the programme has
switches for this. This is useful, if the majority of your reactions will
be true or false. You can then edit the output to toggle the switch for a
small fraction of photolysis reactions.

When adding new reactions, keep to the fixed line format of the input file:

- 1\. character: Switch for reactions `T` or `F`
- 2\. - 4\. character: Reaction number
- 6\. - 55\. character: Photolysis reaction

You can use any placeholder for the reaction number (e.g., spaces or 'x')
as it is overwritten by the programme. The remaining parts of the line
need to be specified explicitly. If you force all reactions to be true or
false, the first charcater of each line will be overwritten as well. There
is no need to adjust parameter `nmj` for the number of output (i.e. true)
reactions as it is automatically calculated by the programme.

You also need to stay to the overall file format with key words used by
TUV 5.2. The programme will search for `===== Available photolysis reactions:`
to identify the beginning of the reaction scheme and for
`===...`
to identify the end.


Running the programme
---------------------

Clone the _numTUVrxn_ repository into the TUV `INPUTS` folder or initialise a git
submodule. Alternatively, you can copy the TUV input file to the _numTUVrxn_
repository.

Run programme with the TUV input file (and relative or absolute folder path)
as the first programme argument and an optional switch for the TUV flags as
second programme argument; e.g. from the TUV INPUTS folder via:

```
./numTUVrxn/numTUVrxn <TUV input file> <switch for reactions>
```

or from inside the repository via:

```
./numTUVrxn [../]<TUV input file> <switch for reactions>
```

The second programme argument is a switch to toggle all reactions to true
(using `T` or `t` as argument) or false (with `F` or `f`). To leave the
switches as specified in the TUV input file, leave the argument blank.

The programme will modify each reaction line and print the output to
temporary output files named `ofile.txt / ofile.dat`. At the end, the
tempoary output file is renamed with the name of the TUV input file.

So be careful:
__All actions of the programme are destructive and will overwrite the
original TUV input file!__

Content modified is:

- The reaction number of photolysis reactions on character 2 - 4
- If forced to `T` or `F`: the switch for photolysis reactions on char. 1
- Parameter `nmj` in the header with the total number of output (true)
  reactions


Version history
===============

Version 1.1.1
-------------
- Reverting enforcment of input file in the folder level above to be able to call
  the programme from the TUV INPUTS folder via `./numTUVrxn/numTUVrxn [arg list]`

Version 1.1
-----------
- Enforcing the input file a folder level above, by adding `../` to the file name
  if obsolete, to allow easy typing of input file names and incorporation of
  numTUVrxn as git submodule in TUV.
- No query, when switch for TUV flag is empty, now programme leaves flags unchanged.
- Bug fixes to properly calculate number of true reactions and assign it to `nmj`

Version 1.0
-----------
- First released version to renumber reactions in the TUV input file after changes
- Numbers are enforced in a consecutive order starting at 1
